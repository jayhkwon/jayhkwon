# Hi, I’m Jay 👋

**Product Scientist / Analytics** — experimentation, causal thinking, and applied ML/AI for real decisions

## About Me
I’m a data scientist with a strong ML/AI foundation who enjoys product-facing problems:
messy data, constrained resources, and decisions that need defensible measurement.

I like building things that are:
- **statistically sound** (clear assumptions, bias checks, robust evaluation)
- **reproducible** (pipelines, versioning, readable analysis)
- **actionable** (tied to product levers and operational reality)
- **deployable** (clear evaluation, sensible baselines, monitoring-ready)

## What I Work On

### Experimentation & Causal Inference
- A/B testing design & analysis (metrics, guardrails, segmentation, interpretation)
- Counterfactual thinking for product questions (not just correlations)
- Practical quasi-experimental approaches when randomization isn’t possible

### Applied ML / AI (classical + deep learning)
- Supervised learning, ranking-style problems, and forecasting when it’s the right tool
- Deep learning familiarity (training/evaluation workflows, representation learning basics)
- Model evaluation: baselines, calibration, error analysis, and monitoring mindset

### Data Systems for Analytics
- Reliable datasets, clean joins, and metric definitions that don’t drift
- ETL/automation patterns that make analysis repeatable
- Communication: turning outputs into decisions (not dashboards for dashboards’ sake)

## Featured Project
### 🧪 A/B Testing on Open Bandit Dataset
A public case study on experiment-style evaluation and analysis workflow.

## Technical Toolbox 🧰
**Languages:** Python · SQL · R  
**ML/AI:** scikit-learn · PyTorch / TensorFlow  
**Stats / Methods:** experimental design · causal inference · time-series  
**Data / Pipelines:** pandas/polars · PySpark · ETL patterns · orchestration-style workflows · Git  
**Communication:** Tableau + clear, decision-oriented narratives

## How I Like to Work
- Start with the decision → define success → choose the simplest method that’s defensible
- Be explicit about assumptions and failure modes
- Prefer reusable tooling and documented workflows
